# Etch-a-sketch

In this project, I build a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch. In which you can make pixel art.

## Documentation

This [Project: Etch-a-sketch](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch) was created as part of The Odin Project curriculum.
The objective of this project is to apply what we learn about DOM manipulation as well as HTML and CSS. The projects' main goal is to learn more about JavaScript methods and advanced CSS.
